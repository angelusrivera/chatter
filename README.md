## 🌟 About
This project is a simple proof of concept realtime chatting app using websockets that leverages the power of Rust and JavaScript (ES6).
I used [ws-rs](https://github.com/housleyjk/ws-rs) as the backend and the [Bulma](https://bulma.io) CSS framework.
It is very much a proof of concept, and will likely not receive many, if any updates.
